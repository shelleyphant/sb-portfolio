Design systems have become an integral part of the web design practice. Creating
a clear understanding of components between clients, designers and developers
helps create a frictionless workflow, reducing the project's time to launch.

## Creating Designs for use at Scale

Designing for website scalability requires a strategic approach to ensure that a
website can grow and evolve without sacrificing user experience or brand
coherence. Two such systems were developed during my time at SWiM Communications
for corporate clients to use across multiple websites. They needed to maintain
branding, while also following accessibility best-practices and have the ability
to be used across multiple CMS's. The systematic approach allows for the
efficient creation and scaling of our designs across multiple platforms and
devices while maintaining consistency and integrity.

## Component- and Library-focused Development

A key element of effective website design systems is modularity. By breaking
down the UI into fundamental, reusable components — such as buttons, form
fields, and navigations — we created libraries of visual elements that can be
assembled in various configurations. This modularity allows for rapid
prototyping and iteration and drastically reduced build times.

More than just branded libraries, we also built a system of unbranded components
that could easily be recoloured with variables. By working with pre-defined
layouts and components, simple sites can be built for clients with small
budgets, while still maintaining a big-budget feel.

## Swapping tools with the changing landscape

Over the last decade, the design landscape has changed dramatically, forcing
teams to keep up with the latest tools. Moving from traditional graphic tools
like Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator into dedicated UI tools like XD and Figma
makes it easier to design for the final platform.

This is also reflected in the development landscape. At Swim Communications I
lead the transition from Bootstrap to Tailwind, encouraging team members to
learn better SASS practices and take advantage of variables for better style
reusibility. By reducing the length of stylesheets needed to be written from
scratch, Tailwind empowered our team to focus more on building features and
improving user experiences, leading to better, more elegant websites.

Website accessibility should be baked-in not painted-on. This is a philosophy
that is brought into many projects I worked on during my time at SWiM
Communications. I designed and developed websites that catered to people with
disabilities, such as vision impairment, hearing disabilities, motor
difficulties, and cognitive impairments, allowing them to perceive, understand,
navigate, and interact with websites.

## Building to a Standard

While it might seem intuitive, taking the time to build accessibility into a
site is far easier than returning later in an attempt to transform elements.
From small considerations like text size and touch elements to larger, more
complex form states, every aspect of a site has an impact.

The WCAG is the best standard for accessibility, with current sites aiming to
reach 2.2 AA status. While this may seem an impossible task, it doesn't take
long for elements to add up to an accessible website.

## Auditing Existing Sites

While at SWiM Communications, I audited several existing and in-progress sites
for accessibility, compiling findings and suggestions into easy-to-implement
reports. While the focus of accessibility is making websites better for users
with disabilities, it is ultimately a developer who needs to interpret the
suggestions and implement them into code.

Some of the tools I used for auditing these sites were:

-   WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), a browser extension that
    highlights potential issues on a page
-   Google Lighthouse, a developer tool that can give a broad overview of
    accessibility
-   OS Screen Reader, for the no-frills text to speech testing
-   WebAIM Contrast Checker, to test the color contrast of text, graphical
    objects, and visual elements
-   W3C Markup Validation, checking the basic structure of a page for errors

## User-focused Design

Accessibility and usability in website design are closely intertwined concepts
that work hand in hand to create a more inclusive and user-friendly digital
environment. While accessibility focuses on making websites usable for people
with disabilities, usability is about designing websites that are efficient,
effective, and satisfying for all users. Incorporating accessibility standards,
naturally enhances the usability of a website by making it more navigable,
understandable, and operable for everyone. Features like clear navigation menus,
keyboard accessibility, adequate contrast ratios, and responsive design not only
aid users with disabilities but also improve the overall user experience, making
websites more intuitive and easier to use for all visitors.

Moreover, designing with accessibility and usability in mind from the outset of
a project encourages a more thoughtful design process that considers the diverse
needs of all users. I follow a user-centric approach, leading to innovations
that benefit a wide range of users, including older individuals, those with
temporary impairments, and even users in challenging environments (like bright
sunlight or noisy areas). By viewing accessibility as an essential aspect of
usability, my sites are more adaptable, resilient, and universally beneficial
digital experiences. This holistic approach not only meets ethical and legal
obligations but also enhances brand reputation, broadens market reach, and
cultivates customer loyalty by demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity.
